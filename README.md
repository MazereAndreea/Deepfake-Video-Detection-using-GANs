# Deepfake Video Detection using GANs

This project aims to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to detect deepfake images in videos. The project leverages deep learning models using PyTorch and utilizes the CelebA dataset for training. The generator creates realistic images from random noise, and the discriminator differentiates between real and fake images.

## Overview

The project involves using a GAN, where the generator and discriminator are both trained on the CelebA dataset to generate and detect fake images. The model is trained using the following steps:

&nbsp;&nbsp;1. **Generator**: 
   Takes random noise as input and generates synthetic images that resemble real data.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. **Discriminator**: 
   Classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. **Training**:
   The generator and discriminator are trained in opposition, continuously improving through each iteration. 
   The generator tries to produce more realistic images, while the discriminator works to better differentiate between real and fake images.

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated based on the discriminator's ability to distinguish fake images generated by the generator. Training progress and results are logged to **TensorBoard**, allowing for real-time visualization of losses and generated image samples.

## Tech Stack

**Frameworks and Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Torchvision

**Modeling:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

**Data Handling:** CelebA dataset, PyTorch DataLoader

**Training & Evaluation:** CUDA, TensorBoard, Adam optimizer, BCELoss


## Training
Training involves running the main.py script. The generator and discriminator will be trained using the CelebA dataset. Training logs and visualizations will be saved in the runs/generative_model directory, which can be viewed using TensorBoard.

To start TensorBoard:

```bash
  tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

## Results
Using these hyperparameters:
**Batch**: 128;
**Epoch**: 10;
**noise for latent vector** = 100;
**learning rate** = 0.0002;
